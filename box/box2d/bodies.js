// Bodies have position and velocity. You can apply forces, torques, and impulses to bodies.
// Bodies can be static, kinematic, or dynamic. Here are the body type definitions:
//
// b2_staticBody
// A static body has does not move under simulation and behaves as if it has infinite mass.
// Internally, Box2D stores zero for the mass and the inverse mass. 
// Static bodies can be moved manually by the user. 
// A static body has zero velocity.
// Static bodies do not collide with other static or kinematic bodies.
//
// b2_kinematicBody
// A kinematic body moves under simulation according to its velocity.
// Kinematic bodies do not respond to forces.
// They can be moved manually by the user
// , but normally a kinematic body is moved by setting its velocity.
// A kinematic body behaves as if it has infinite mass, however,
// Box2D stores zero for the mass and the inverse mass.
// Kinematic bodies do not collide with other static or kinematic bodies.
//
// b2_dynamicBody
// A dynamic body is fully simulated. They can be moved manually by the user,
// but normally
// they move according to forces. A dynamic body can collide with all body types. 
// A dynamic body always has finite, non-zero mass.
// If you try to set the mass of a dynamic body to zero, 
// it will automatically acquire a mass of one kilogram.
//
// Bodies are the backbone for fixtures. Bodies carry fixtures 
// and move them around in the world. Bodies are always rigid bodies in Box2D.
// That means that two fixtures attached to the same rigid body never move relative to each other.
//
// Fixtures have collision geometry and density.
// Normally,
// bodies acquire their mass properties from the fixtures. 
// However, you can override the mass properties after a body is constructed. This is discussed below.
//
// You usually keep pointers to all the bodies you create.
// This way you can query the body positions to update the positions of your graphical entities. 
// You should also keep body pointers so you can destroy them when you are done with them.
//
// Before a body is created you must create a body definition (b2BodyDef). 
// The body definition holds the data needed to create and initialize a body.
//
// Box2D copies the data out of the body definition; it does not keep a pointer to the body definition.
// This means you can recycle a body definition to create multiple bodies.
//
// Letâ€™s go over some of the key members of the body definition.
//
// Body Type
// As discussed at the beginning of this chapter, there are three different body types: static,
// kinematic, and dynamic. You should establish the body type at creation
// because changing the body type later is expensive.
//
// bodyDef.type = b2_dynamicBody;
//
// Setting the body type is mandatory.
//
// Position and Angle
// The body definition gives you the chance to initialize the position of the body on creation.
// This has far better performance than creating the body at the world origin and then moving the body.
//
// Caution
//
// Do not create a body at the origin and then move it. If you create several bodies at the origin,
// then performance will suffer.
//
// A body has two main points of interest. The first point is the body's origin.
// Fixtures and joints are attached relative to the body's origin.
// The second point of interest is the center of mass.
// The center of mass is determined from mass distribution of the attached shapes 
// or is explicitly set with b2MassData. Much of Box2D's internal computations 
// use the center of mass position. For example b2Body stores the linear velocity for the center of mass.
//
// When you are building the body definition, you may not know where the center of mass is located.
// Therefore you specify the position of the body's origin. You may also specify the body's angle in radians, 
// which is not affected by the position of the center of mass. If you later change the mass properties of the body, 
// then the center of mass may move on the body, but the origin position 
// does not change and the attached shapes and joints do not move.
//
// bodyDef.position.Set(0.0f, 2.0f);   // the body's origin position.
// bodyDef.angle = 0.25f * b2_pi;      // the body's angle in radians.
function bodDef() {
 
}

// You may wish a body to be created but not participate in collision or dynamics. 
// This state is similar to sleeping except the body will not be woken by other bodies 
// and the body's fixtures will not be placed in the broad-phase. 
// This means the body will not participate in collisions, ray casts, etc.
//
// You can create a body in an inactive state and later re-activate it. bodyDef.active = true;
// Joints may be connected to inactive bodies. These joints will not be simulated. 
// *be careful when you activate a body that its joints are not distorted.
//
// User Data is a void pointer. This gives you a hook to link your application objects to bodies. 
// You should be consistent to use the same object type for all body user data.

// Game simulation usually generates a sequence of images that are played at some frame rate.
// This is called discrete simulation. In discrete simulation, rigid bodies can move by
// a large amount in one time step. If a physics engine doesn't account for the large motion, 
// you may see some objects incorrectly pass through each other. This effect is called tunneling.
// By default, Box2D uses continuous collision detection (CCD) to prevent dynamic bodies
// from tunneling through static bodies. This is done by sweeping shapes from their old position 
// to their new positions. The engine looks for new collisions during the sweep 
// and computes the time of impact (TOI) for these collisions. Bodies are moved to their
// first TOI and then halted for the remainder of the time step.
//
// Normally CCD is not used between dynamic bodies. This is done to keep performance reasonable. 
// In some game scenarios you need dynamic bodies to use CCD. For example, you may want to shoot
// a high speed bullet at a stack of dynamic bricks. Without CCD, the bullet might tunnel through
// the bricks.
//
// Fast moving objects in Box2D can be labeled as bullets. Bullets will perform CCD with both
